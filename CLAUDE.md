# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a comprehensive research repository focused on Autonomous Agents, containing curated collections of research papers and resources related to autonomous agents, LLM agents, and AGI research. The repository is primarily documentation-based with no executable code.

## Structure

The repository consists of:
- `README.md`: Main chronological listing of 2025 research papers (part 1/3)
- `resources/`: Directory containing:
  - Research papers organized by year (2023, 2024, 2025 parts 2-3, Earlier)
  - `Autonomous_Agents_Resources.md`: Comprehensive resource collection with definitions, concepts, and categorized research areas
  - Logo image file

## Content Format

### Research Papers
- Papers are organized chronologically with the most recent at the top
- Each entry includes:
  - Paper title with arXiv link
  - Framework/method name in bold when applicable
  - 2-3 bullet points summarizing key contributions
  - Horizontal rule separator between entries

### Resources Document
Organized into major categories:
- Definitions (Agent types, AGI, Superintelligence)
- Memory systems
- Perception capabilities
- Reasoning approaches
- Planning methodologies
- Character/personality aspects
- Operating environments (GUIs, tools, OS integration)
- Theoretical foundations

## Maintenance Tasks

When adding new research papers:
1. Add to the appropriate chronological file based on publication date
2. Maintain consistent formatting with existing entries
3. Include arXiv link and 2-3 key contribution bullet points
4. Update resource links if paper introduces new concepts or frameworks

## Citation Format

The repository uses the following citation:
```
@misc{MaattaAutonomousAgents2023,
  author = {Teemu Maatta},
  title = {Autonomous Agents},
  year = {2023},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/tmgthb/Autonomous-Agents}},
  note = {Accessed: YYYY-MM-DD}
}
```

## File Characteristics

- Files use CRLF line terminators
- Markdown files contain very long lines (>1000 characters)
- Heavy use of markdown links and formatting
- No build, test, or deployment processes required
